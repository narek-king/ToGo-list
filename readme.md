## About ToGo List

The repo represents simple CRUD application of places for visiting. It involves google maps and search bar for finding and adding a new place on the map and in the list. It is possible to edit name of the place, mark as visited and delete it.

The tech-stack used in this app is as follows: PHP with Laravel framework, Vue.js and SQLite as main storage of data.
The database is selected SQLite for making setup of the development environment easily. It can be expanded to for example MySQL if the app grows.
The coordinates of the place is just a string but it should be a geo-spatial field in the DB. It can be changed in future
The app uses simple session base authentication but the repo has a branch where the authentication is planed to be a JSON WEB Token.
Future work includes filtering, sorting, searching and pagination of the table of places.
